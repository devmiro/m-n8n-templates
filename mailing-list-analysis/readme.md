    *   Configure the Google Sheets node with your credentials.
2.  **Create Google Sheets:**
    *   Create a spreadsheet called "Non Business Emails" with the columns "email" and "isCustomDomain".

## Recommendation
I'm using this template to better understand my audience. However, it could also be integrated into another workflow for outreach. For instance, you could adapt the prompt to gather more information about their business or even identify the person most likely to make decisions. Eventually, you can use this information to draft more effective emails than those generated by generic templates lacking context.
